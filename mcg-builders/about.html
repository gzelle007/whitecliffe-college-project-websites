                    The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (Building System Performance) has funded the following building standards, used for Building Code compliance, for free download.

                    This initiative fits within Standards New Zealand’s strategy of working with regulators and industry to get more standards pre-funded, as well as enabling better access to standards that make a difference to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. This, in turn, helps grow New Zealand for all.
                    
                    As a regulator of the building system, MBIE wants to reduce barriers that prevent people ‘doing the right thing’ within the New Zealand building system.
                    
                    Please note that Standard NZS 4246:2016 Energy efficiency - Installing bulk thermal insulation in residential buildings is sponsored by Tenancy Services.
